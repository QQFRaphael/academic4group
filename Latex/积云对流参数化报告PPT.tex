Integrating over the vertical between the surface and the top of the atmosphere can be done easily as the flux divergences represent perfect differentials. This leads to the following important budget constraints:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{Convective Parameterization}
\begin{itemize}
\item column integrated heat can only be changed through radiation, surface sensible heat flux, and precipitation
\item column integrated water vapor can only change through removal by surface precipitation and input by surface moisture flux
\item total momentum is only changed through surface friction (an external force), therefore convective transport conserves momentum

\centering{Convective Closure}\par
The cloud model determines the vertical structure of convective heating and moistening (microphysics, variation of mass flux with height, entrainment/detrainment assumptions). The determination of the overall magnitude of the heating (i.e., surface precipitation in deep convection) requires the determination of the mass flux at cloud base. This is called the closure problem.

\begin{itemize}
\item Deep convective closure: CAPE
\begin{itemize}
\item Prominent closure types for deep convection assume an equilibrium that establishes over a typical time scale of one hour between the production of CAPE (or cloud work function) by the large-scale, and its consumption by the convection. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Shallow convective closures
\begin{itemize}
\item CAPE adjustment for shallow convection, but with a longer adjustment time-scale of typically three hours.
\item Grant (2001) developed a simple equilibrium closure, where the cloud base convective mass flux is proportional to the product of the updraught fraction $a$ and a convective scale velocity $w^{*}$, the latter being proportional to the boundary-layer or cloud base height $z_{PBL}$ and the surface sensible heat flux

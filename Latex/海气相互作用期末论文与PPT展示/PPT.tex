From 1979, Arctic sea ice is decreasing in every season, every continuous ten years. The reconstruction data shows that Arctic sea ice disappeared speed and the increasing rate of sea level is never happened since 1459. The snow cover area is decrease from the middle of 20th century. It seems that the Arctic sea ice may totally disappear in the coming 30 years.

\frametitle{Summary}
In this paper, we try to explore the climate impact of decreasing of Arctic sea ice. The most profound effect is that it will affect the general circulation while its mechanism is not clear yet. The decreasing of sea ice will also affect the global precipitation, relative humidity and so on. All the physical processes need further investigation.
